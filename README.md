 Excel was then used to evaluate for successful campaigns, and then for unsuccessful campaigns, in addition to:

  * The mean number of backers.

  * The median number of backers.

  * The minimum number of backers.

  * The maximum number of backers.

  * The variance of the number of backers.

  * The standard deviation of the number of backers.

2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
